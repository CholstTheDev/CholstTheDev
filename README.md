My name is Casper Dahlin Holst, which at some point became Cholst

Iâ€™m interested in developing games and tools for games.

I'm currently working on a in-unity voxel tool, as well as experimenting with others in unity with various random ideas and mechanics. I'm also setting up a private server for gamehosting
